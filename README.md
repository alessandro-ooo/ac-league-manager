This project's purpose is to let users manage their liveries without a "third person" / "middleman" between them and the server league they want to race in. There may be some issues with having a middleman to upload liveries, such as:
[*] Files may not be uploaded correctly: there is a strict process you need to follow to correctly upload the user livery.
[*] Timing: Due to different timezones there may be a lot of delay and your liveries might not be uploaded in time for the race.
[*] TBA
[*] TBA
